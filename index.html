                <p class="lead">As the largest planet orbiting the sun, Jupiter has had a profound influence on the solar system. But its origin remains a profound mystery. To learn how Jupiter formed and how it has evolved, Juno will study the gas giant’s gravitational andmagnetic fields, and explore the swirling clouds that form Jupiter’s colorful, trademark atmosphere. The spacecraft will also reveal what Jupiter is made of – and how much of it is water. <br /><br />Jupiter was likely the first of the planets to form because it contains a lot of the same light gases that the sun is made of – hydrogen and helium. After the first few million years in the star’s life, it generated a wind that blew away most of the light gases that remained from the original nebula. For Jupiter to be primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, it must have formed while there was still a lot of those light gases around – when the solar system was young.</p>

              <p class="lead">Although the main spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin, its instruments and components come from all over the world. Juno is shipped in pieces to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where it’s assembled and put on top of an atlas rocket that will blast it off into space.<br><br> While building the spacecraft, engineers take extreme care to keep it clean. They work in a clean room and wear special suits that prevent dirt, dust, and hair from contaminating the craft. <br><br>Engineers have to test every part of the spacecraft to ensure that it will survive the harsh environment of outer space. They simulate the conditions that Juno may encounter in test chambers. For example, they see how well components can withstand heat and vibration – a test often called shake ‘n’ bake.</p>

              <p class="lead">Once Jupiter’s gravity captures Juno, the spacecraft begins its carefully designed orbit that allows it to closely examine the planet while avoiding its harmful radiation. And because Juno relies on solar power, the orbit has to keep the spacecraft exposed to sunlight for its entire mission.<br><br>Once Juno reaches Jupiter in 2016, it will follow a special orbit called a polar orbit, which takes the spacecraft over Jupiter’s poles, traversing the planet in a north-south direction. Because polar orbits are best for mapping and monitoring a planet, many satellites that study the earth follow a similar path. This type of orbit has never been tried around Jupiter.<br><br> Juno takes 11 days to complete a revolution while Jupiter takes only 10 hours to spin around once. Mission planners designed the trajectory so that the spacecraft passes over a different section of Jupiter during each orbit. After completing the mission’s 33 planned orbits, Juno will have covered the entire surface of Jupiter.</p>
