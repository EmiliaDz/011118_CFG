      <h1>The Giant Planet Story is the Story of the Solar System</h1>
      <p>Juno's principal goal is to understand the origin and evolution of Jupiter. Underneath its dense cloud cover,
        Jupiter safeguards secrets to the fundamental processes and conditions that governed our solar system during
        its formation. As our primary example of a giant planet, Jupiter can also provide critical knowledge for
        understanding the planetary systems being discovered around other stars.<br><br>With its suite of science
        instruments, Juno will investigate the existence of a solid planetary core, map Jupiter's intense magnetic
        field, measure the amount of water and ammonia in the deep atmosphere, and observe the planet's auroras.<br><br>Juno
        will let us take a giant step forward in our understanding of how giant planets form and the role these titans
        played in putting together the rest of the solar system.</p>

    <h1>Mission Milestones</h1>
    <p class="lead">NASA has approved an update to Juno’s science operations until July 2021. This provides for an
      additional 41 months in orbit around Jupiter and will enable Juno to achieve its primary science objectives. Juno
      is in 53-day orbits rather than 14-day orbits as initially planned because of a concern about valves on the
      spacecraft’s fuel system. This longer orbit means that it will take more time to collect the needed science data.

    <h1>Juno's Mythical Connection</h1>
    <p class="lead">In Greek and Roman mythology, Jupiter drew a veil of clouds around himself to hide his mischief. It
      was Jupiter's wife, the goddess Juno, who was able to peer through the clouds and reveal Jupiter's true nature.
      The Juno spacecraft will also look beneath the clouds to see what the planet is up to, not seeking signs of
      misbehavior, but helping us to understand the planet's structure and history.</p>

    <h1>Jupiter's Origins and Interior</h1>
    <p>T. Pyle (SSC) Theories about solar system formation all begin with the collapse of a giant cloud of
      gas and dust, or nebula, most of which formed the infant sun. Like the sun, Jupiter is mostly hydrogen and
      helium, so it must have formed early, capturing most of the material left after our star came to be. How this
      happened, however, is unclear. Did a massive planetary core form first and gravitationally capture all that gas,
      or did an unstable region collapse inside the nebula, triggering the planet's formation? Differences between
      these scenarios are profound.<br><br>

      Even more importantly, the composition and role of icy planetesimals, or small proto-planets, in planetary
      formation hangs in the balance – and with them, the origin of Earth and other terrestrial planets. Icy
      planetesimals likely were the carriers of materials like water and carbon compounds that are the fundamental
      building blocks of life.<br><br>

      Unlike Earth, Jupiter's giant mass allowed it to hold onto its original composition, providing us with a way of
      tracing our solar system's history. Juno will measure the amount of water and ammonia in Jupiter's atmosphere and
      determine if the planet actually has a solid core, directly resolving the origin of this giant planet and thereby
      the solar system. By mapping Jupiter's gravitational and magnetic fields, Juno will reveal the planet's interior
      structure and measure the mass of the core.</p>
